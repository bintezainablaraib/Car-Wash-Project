# Car-Wash-Project

Introduction:
Our Project features a simple Car Management System; operating on queues/linked lists that prompts Users to choose through a range of options to take their Order and add them to queues. This simplifies data management in a Workshop System and helps with record keeping.


Working
•	We’ve used 3 Script Files; one for the Menu; then the Queues Implementation and lastly for the Orders.

•	Our Queue is Circular, and we’ve used a Linked List to implement it. It can be expanded freely.

•	Multithreading Processing: if the current order in the queue and the next order are different then we can process them simultaneously- this will save processing time.

Features
•	We’ve added features for either Car Wash or Car Maintenance and an Appointment System.

•	The Car Wash provides Options for Customization and Interior/Exterior Cleaning; the latter provides Options for Oil Change and the like.

•	We have a Time Module implemented to relay the time passed between certain operations and play them synchronously.

•	Dequeue and Enqueue operations are used to delete items in the queue and append them respectively.

•	Our Receipt Function prints the total cost of the Orders.

•	And we have a Random Order Function to create an Order at random.


Shortcomings:
•	In the System we can manage our Orders a lot better.

•	Our Appointment System can be greatly improved.

•	The command prompt accepts either input or output and a Graphic User Interface would’ve helped us with this situation. We have experimented with several command prompts but they haven’t worked.


Conclusion
Expandability- we can add more features and implement this software to any data management system such as that needed in certain businesses, libraries, schools, or hospitals.
