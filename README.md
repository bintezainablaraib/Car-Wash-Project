# Car-Wash-Project
Introduction:
Our Project features a simple Car Management System; operating on queues/linked lists that prompts Users to choose through a range of options to take their Order and add them to queues. This simplifies data management in a Workshop System and helps with record keeping.


Working
•	We’ve used 3 Script Files; one for the Menu; then the Queues Implementation and lastly for the Orders.

•	Our Queue is Circular, and we’ve used a Linked List to implement it. It can be expanded freely.

•	Multithreading Processing: if the current order in the queue and the next order are different then we can process them simultaneously- this will save processing time
